<h1> <b>Greetings to someone who is reading this!</b></h1>

<p> <u><mark>My name is Lander R. Driza, and I am currently 15 years old.</mark></u> My motto for life is <b>"Life is too short, so live your life to the fullest,"</b> <i>I have so many favorite things to do, but some of those are cooking and, of course, eating foods.</i> <u>I also love the colors green and red. I do not like them in light colours; I want them dark, like Sage Green and Redwood.</u> <mark>I also love playing online games such as Mobile Legends and Roblox because it has been one of my hobbies these past few months.</mark> <b>My father's name is Rolando T. Driza,</b> and <u>my mother is Isminaida R. Driza.</u> <mark><i>my older sister, Xena, who is currently 27 years old and lives in a different country to work to meet the needs of her own family and, of course, our parents and me.</i></mark> <b> I also have an older brother; he is Lester R. Driza,</b> <del>who died in 2019 at the age of 25.</del> <mark>My sister has 2 children, Shian and Stefan, who are in my parents' care because she is not here in the Philippines. Shian is already 10 years old, while Stefan is 7 years old.</mark> </p>

<p> <b>When my older brother died, that was one of the most challenging experiences I and my family faced.</b> Everyone is sad and feels empty because we lost one of the most important person in our lives.<u><b>The most impressive event that happened to my life way back when I was young was when I drank alcohol with my friends, and my parents did not know it.</b></u> <del>I was so scared and afraid that they would find out, they would hurt and scold, and they would not let me go again outside with my friends.</del> <mark>But thankfully, when they found out, they didn't scold me and just laughed at me.</mark> <i>I, personally, feel like my value changed and increased really well over the year because I had so many small achievements and experiences that made myself stronger, my mental health, and my personal value. </i> </p>

<p> <b>Everything makes me happy, even the smallest things.</b> <mark>But, to be more specific, it just makes me delighted when someone makes even small efforts for me, such as when we're hanging out;</mark> <b>they never fail to make me feel welcome and do not make me feel out of place. A year ago, if you would ask me, </b> <mark>"What are your plans?"</mark> <i> I would not respond because I honestly did not also know. But as I have gotten older,</i> <u>I have realised that I want to be a chef; I want to learn more about cooking and open my own restaurant in the future.</u> <b>And if I don't become a chef, I have another plans and that is to be a flight attendant or a seafarer because I also want to travel around the world while doing the work I love.</b> </p>

<p> <b>SHE IS MY MOTHER</b> </p>
